# EC601_Twitter_API


Followed the Twitter tutorial through https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/postman-getting-started . Signed up a developer account, created a project and connect an App named “noerrors”. Following along, the keys&tokens window shows the API key, API secret key, and Bearer token. The keys were saved into a separate document for future use. 

Downloaded a sample code from Github, select the “recent_search.py” document. Installed the requests library in the terminal by running “pip install requests”. Then copied the personal Bearer Token to the line 7 in the “recent_search.py”. Run the program showing the user’s Twitter account activity information in the recent 7 days. Result as the screenshot here.
